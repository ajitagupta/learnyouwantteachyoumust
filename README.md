# Learn you want. Teach you must.

There is no way out. If you want to continue growing and don't want your pace to lag you have to teach - students, peers, interns, family, friends, superiors, seniors, juniors and the list goes on.

## Gaps in Knowledge.
Don't compromise with your competency. Identify your weaknesses and inconsistencies. Look up a reliable source of information and fill the gaps.
## Format.
Be it a blog, a book, a magazine, a format presentation, conference talk, guest lecture, teaching assistantship at your old university, mentorship or supervision - this is upto you and your luck of striking an opportunity.
## Structure.
Break down the content into sensible chunks. Then, make the complex simple - in written word - for your own understanding and guiding thread.
## References.
Use resources as aid to deliver the key messages with power.
## Confidence.
Special teaching skills matters less. Confidence matters more!
