# Learn you want. Teach you must.

There is no way out. If you want to continue growing and don't want your pace to lag you have to teach - students, peers, interns, family, friends, superiors, seniors, juniors and the list goes on. However, don't precipitate your actions! Don't rush! It takes time to reach that level but once you're there you can cruise along.

## Focus.
Focus is the opposite of distraction. It helps you be productive and generate results consistently. You might know all possible productivity hacks and techniques in the world, but if you can't sit down and focus on a task you are getting nowhere. Subdue the urge to pour another cup of coffee, check your email, phone or Facebook account, and get started! Once you gain momentum it will be relatively easy to maintain your focus.
## Gaps in Knowledge.
Don't compromise with your competency. Identify your weaknesses and inconsistencies. Look up a reliable source of information and fill the gaps.
## Format.
Be it a blog, a book, a tutorial, conference talk, guest lecture, teaching assistantship at your old university, mentorship or supervision - this is upto you and your luck of striking a pertinent opportunity.
## Structure.
Break down the content into sensible chunks of content. Then, make the complex simple - in written word - for your own understanding and guiding thread.
## References.
Use resources as aid to deliver the key messages with power.
## Confidence.
Special teaching skills matters less. Confidence matters more!
