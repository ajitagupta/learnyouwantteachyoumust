# Learn you want. Teach you must.

In this post we stress the importance of teaching. A technique for internalizing ideas is for you to teach others what you are learning. You become what you teach. You teach what you are. As John Sonmez puts it, there is no way out of teaching [1]. If you want to continue growing and get ahead in your career you have to teach - students, peers, interns, family, friends, superiors, seniors, juniors and the list goes on. This is where the depth comes, as opposed to a cursory understanding of the subject matter. You only really know something to the degree to which you can teach it to someone else and have them understand and apply it in their own lives.

## Knowledge.
Knowledge comes from consistency and hard work. Knowledge gives a sense of control. Knowledge is power. Knowledge creates competency! Yet, knowledge is not equivalent to expertise. Expertise comes from training. Identify holes and inconsistencies in your knowledge - they can turn out to be pretty expensive for your employer and embarrassing for you. Look up a reliable source of information, join a workshop or enroll for a college degree and fill the gaps.
## Format.
The best way to teach is to help. And it's an inherent part of human nature (!). Therefore, by extension, that makes all of us teachers (!). Grow your circle of influence! Be it a blog, a book, tutorial sessions, speaking at a conference, an open-source contribution, a teaching assistantship at your university, mentorship or supervision, start working on it. By the time your initiative gains traction you will have set up an effective marketing strategy with an initial audience.
## Structure.
Take all the information you learnt and create a lesson that anybody could understand. Break down the content into sensible tasks. Putting together a broad overview will make it easier for you to dole out the time you want to dedicate to the explanation of each of them and ensure you are making steady progress towards your ultimate goal. Having multiple tasks will also make it more likely to understand and explain them correctly. Now, make the complex simple - in written word. Use literature resources such as books as aid to deliver key messages with power. Next, talk your pupils through all the concepts they must understand. A sample structure looks as follows [2]:
* Big picture: What can you do with all the individual elements? How are they related?
* How to get started
* 20% of the knowledge one needs to be most efficient and get 80% work done (Pareto Principle)
* What comes next

The minute you learn something, turn around and teach it to others. Share your reading list. Point to helpful reference materials. Create some tutorials and post them online.
Use pictures, words and video. Take people step-by-step through the process. Make people better at something they want to be better at [3]. By teaching someone else you learn what you understand and what you don't. You discover your strnegths and weaknesses. That way you can go back and review and achieve a greater understanding of almost anything. If you can present information in a way that is cohesive, simple and complete then you've mastered the subject, and if you can't, then you know exactly what to tackle next.

## Multitasking.
You won't get around multitasking if you want to teach! According to research conducted by the American Psychological Association [3] multitasking reduces productivity. A Stanford University study concluded that multitasking lowers efficiency and may impair your cognitive control.

Assuming it takes some time to reach the focused mode of thinking (you require about seventeen minutes to refocus on an important task after being distracted, for any
reason), switching tasks indeed doesn't sound very efficient. However, this doesn't hold true for all tasks. Batching is an effective strategy to perform multitasking [1]. Let me articulate: Batching refers to working on a series of *related* tasks *in a row* rather than spread out. With batching you have enough time to build up **and** maintain the deep focus necessary to get your work done.
## Confidence.
Special teaching skills matter less. Confidence matters more! This attitude of composed, confident expectation that all will be well is an experience of higher consciousness. Religious people refer to this as prayer, and it is said that prayer is the highest form of affirmation.


Teaching people doesn't subtract value from what you do, it actually adds to it. When you teach someone how to do your work, you are, in effect, generating more interest in
your work. People feel closer to your work because you're letting them in on what you know. Best of all, when you share your knowledge and your work with others, you receive an education in return [4].
