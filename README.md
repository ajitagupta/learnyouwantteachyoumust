## Format.
Be it a blog, a presentation, teaching assistantship at your old university, mentoring an intern or supervising academic projects - this is upto you.
## Structure.
Break down the content into sensible chunks. Then, make the complex simple - in written word for your own understanding and guiding thread.
## References.
Use resources as aid to deliver the key messages with power.
