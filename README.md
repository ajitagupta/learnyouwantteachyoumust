# Learn you want. Teach you must.

There is no way out. If you want to continue growing and don't want your pace to lag you have to teach - students, peers, interns, family, friends, superiors, seniors, juniors and the list goes on. However, don't precipitate your actions! Don't rush! It takes time to reach that level but once you're there you can cruise along.

## Focus.
It all starts with focus. Focus is the opposite of distraction. You might know all possible productivity hacks and techniques in the world, but if you can't sit down and focus on a task you are getting nowhere. Subdue the urge to pour another cup of coffee, check your email, phone or Facebook account. Also make sure you are done with other important tasks of the day to prevent further interruptions. Now get started! Once you gain momentum it will be relatively easy to maintain your focus. Having concrete goals also adds up to your attention span and makes it easier to stay productive (see [Trello](https://trello.com/)).
## Knowledge.
Knowledge comes from consistency and hard work. Knowledge gives a sense of control. However, knowledge is not equivalent to expertise. Expertise comes from teaching and other forms of training. Don't compromise with your competency. Identify your weaknesses and inconsistencies in your knowledge. Look up a reliable source of information and fill the gaps. Or else, you will eventually end up in an embarrassing situation.
## Format.
Be it a blog, a book, a tutorial, conference talk, guest lecture, teaching assistantship at your old university, mentorship or supervision - this is upto you and your luck of striking a pertinent opportunity.
## Structure.
Break down the content into sensible chunks of content. Then, make the complex simple - in written word - for your own understanding and guiding thread.
## References.
Use resources as aid to deliver the key messages with power.
## Confidence.
Special teaching skills matters less. Confidence matters more!
