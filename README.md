# Learn you want. Teach you must.

In this post we stress the importance of teaching and how it can be conducted. As a matter of fact, there is no way out [1]. If you want to continue growing and get ahead in your career you have to teach - students, peers, interns, family, friends, superiors, seniors, juniors and the list goes on. This is where the depth comes, as opposed to a cursory understanding of the subject matter. However, don't precipitate your actions! Don't rush! It takes time to reach that level but once you're there you can cruise along.

## Focus.
It all starts with focus. Focus is the opposite of distraction. You might know all possible productivity hacks and techniques in the world, but if you can't sit down and focus on a task you are getting nowhere. Subdue the urge to pour another cup of coffee, check your email, phone or Facebook account. Also make sure you are done with other important tasks of the day to prevent further interruptions. Now get started! Once you gain momentum it will be relatively easy to maintain your focus. Having concrete goals also adds up to your attention span and makes it easier to stay productive (see [Trello](https://trello.com/)).
## Knowledge.
Knowledge comes from consistency and hard work. Knowledge gives a sense of control. Knowledge creates competency! Yet, knowledge is not equivalent to expertise. Expertise comes from teaching and other forms of training. Identify holes and inconsistencies in your knowledge - they can turn out to be pretty expensive for your employer and embarassing for you. It is also regarded as unprofessional. Look up a reliable source of information, join a workshop or enrol for a college degree and fill the gaps.
## Format.
The best way to teach is to help. And it's an inherent part of human nature (!). Consequentially, that makes all of us teachers (!). So, be it a blog, a book, a tutorial, conference talk, guest lecture, teaching assistantship at your old university, mentorship or supervision (this is upto you and your luck of striking a pertinent opportunity) start working on it. By the time your initiative gains traction you will have set up an effective marketing strategy with a stable audience. Go ahead - give it a shot!
## Structure.
Break down the content into sensible tasks. Putting together a broad overview will make it easier for you to dole out the time you want to dedicate to the explanation of each of them and ensure you are making steady progress towards your ultimate goal. Then, make the complex simple - in written word. Use literature resources such as books as aid to deliver key messages with power.
## Multitasking.
According to research conducted by the American Psychological Association [2] multitasking reduces productivity. Assuming it takes time to reach a focused mode of thinking switching tasks indeed doesn't sound very efficient. However, this doesn't hold true for all tasks. Batching is an effective strategy to perform multitasking [1]. Let me articulate: Batching refers to working on a series of related tasks in a row rather than spread out (e.g. over a month) task-switching. With batching you can build up the deep focus you require to get your work done and focus is not broken on the bigger, more time-consuming tasks.
## Confidence.
Special teaching skills matter less. Confidence matters more!
